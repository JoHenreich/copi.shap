You will design a three-page responsive website for a fictional coffee shop of your choice. This project demonstrates your ability to combine creativity with technical web design skills using HTML and CSS.

    You may create your own coffee shop name and logo (simple text logos are fine if you do not want to design one).

    You may choose your own images — either create them yourself or download royalty-free images from sources like Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay.

    All pages must share a consistent layout and theme (header, footer, navigation).

    The website must be fully navigable — each page must link to the others.

Pages required:

    index.html (Homepage)

    menu.html (Menu & Prices)

    events.html (Events & Activities)
